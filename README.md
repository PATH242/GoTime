# GoTime
### A simple go game using haskell and CodeWorld GUI.

To start the game, run
```
stack run
```
All game functionalities are implemented, including checking for the rule of ko and not allowing suicidal moves.
Game end is not yet implemented. Black will always win for now but scores are not even calculated, TODOs are left in code.
